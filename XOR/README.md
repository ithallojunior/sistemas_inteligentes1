# XOR Example (and MLP itself)
## Milestones:
  - Bias;
  - Momentum;
  - Weight range
  - Error plot on the go.

## Things (yet) to go:
  - ~~Add possibility to select the weights range~~;
  - ~~Add momentum~~;
  - ~~Correct bias~~;
  - ~~View the error decreasing on the go~~;
  - Correct error plot on the go;
  - Comparison table between parameters.
