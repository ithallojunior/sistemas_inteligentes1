# Sistemas Inteligentes 1

## What is it?
  
  Repository to track (and backup, of course) my achievements 
  for the course of Sistemas Inteligentes 1 (*Intelligent Systems 1*) 
  as requirement to obtain an MSc major of Biomedical Engineer.

## MLP
  
  It includes a multilayer perceptron algorithm that features:
  
  + Adjustable hidden layer size;
  + Three (I'm not counting the linear) activation functions;
  + Learning rate (alpha);
  + Momentum;
  + Maximum iterations and stop by error;
  + Bias (or not);
  + Seed for repeatable results;
  + Other things.
  
#### Have fun.
